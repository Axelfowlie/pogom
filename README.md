##Installation:

**Note:** If you are upgrading from the last version, you will have to update and/or reinstall the requirements.

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/favll/pogom.git`
2. Install the dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start the server by running `python runserver.py`

**Pro-Tip:** Use the `-H` and `-P` flag to specify host and port. E.g. `-H "127.0.0.1" -P 5001` will tell the webserver to listen to localhost requests on port 5001. You can then head over and take a look at the map at `http://127.0.0.1:5001/`. If you want the server to listen on all public IPs use the host `0.0.0.0`. This will allow you to access your server from other machines.

There's no other flags besides  `-H` and `-P`, everything else is configured through the Web UI.

##Usage

 - Visit `http://<ip>:<port>/` (by default: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`)
 - On the first run you will be redirected to a configuration page
   - Enter your Google Maps Api Key
   - Enter all accounts and passwords to be used for scanning
   - Optionally protect the configuration with a password (only authenticated users can access the config and change scan locations)
 - Go back to `http://<ip>:<port>/` to view the map
 - Add scan locations simply by clicking on the map
